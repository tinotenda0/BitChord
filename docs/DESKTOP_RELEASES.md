# Desktop releases and the update check

How a desktop build gets its version, how its files are named on the releases page, and how the
app finds out a newer one exists. Windows already follows all of this; every Linux variant
(AppImage, deb, rpm, and anything added later) has to follow the same protocol. If a Linux file
breaks one of the rules below, the update check silently stops working for Linux users.

## 1. One version, stamped from one place

- The version is a plain string such as `1.8` or `1.8-beta1`. No leading `v`.
- `desktopApp/build.gradle.kts` reads it from `-Pbitchord.version=...` and falls back to a default
  (`appVersion`). CI passes the tag with the `v` removed (`v1.8` becomes `1.8`).
- The app reads the same value at runtime from the `bitchord.version` system property. It is baked
  into every package by `jvmArgs("-Dbitchord.version=$appVersion")` in the `compose.desktop`
  block of `desktopApp/build.gradle.kts`, which covers exe, msi, deb, rpm and the AppImage (it
  wraps the same app image, so `appimage.sh` needs nothing). Do not remove that line, and do not
  add a separate launcher that skips it: the app would then report the hardcoded fallback and the
  update check would compare against the wrong version.
- A pre-release version carries a suffix after a dash: `1.8-beta1`. The update check treats
  `1.8-beta1` as older than `1.8`, and `1.8` as older than `1.9`.

## 2. The installer's own version is numeric

Installer formats reject `-beta1`, so `nativePackageVersion` in `desktopApp/build.gradle.kts`
builds a separate numeric one: `major.minor.desktopVersionCode`, for example `1.8.26`.

- Bump `desktopVersionCode` for **every** build you publish, betas included. Windows only
  upgrades in place when the numeric version goes up; the same number is treated as "already
  installed".
- deb and rpm take the same `nativePackageVersion`, so `apt`/`dnf` upgrade ordering works the same
  way. Do not hand-edit package versions anywhere else.
- Never change the Windows `upgradeUuid`. For Linux, never rename the package (`packageName =
  "BitChord"`) or the upgrade path breaks.

## 3. File names on the releases page

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) renames build output to these exact
patterns, where `<v>` is the version from section 1:

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| Windows | `BitChord-<v>-windows-x64-setup.exe` (what the update check downloads) |
| Windows | `BitChord-<v>-windows-x64.msi` |
| Windows | `BitChord-<v>-windows-x64-portable.zip` |
| Linux | `BitChord-<v>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` (preferred by the update check) |
| Linux | `BitChord-<v>-linux-amd64.deb` (used if there is no AppImage) |
| Linux | `BitChord-<v>-linux-x86_64.rpm` |
| macOS | `BitChord-<v>-macos-arm64.dmg` (Apple Silicon; also `.pkg` and `.zip`) |
| macOS | `BitChord-<v>-macos-x64.dmg` (Intel; also `.pkg` and `.zip`) |

Rules:

- Keep the platform tail exactly as above. The update check matches on the ending
  (`.AppImage`, then `-linux-amd64.deb` on Linux; `-windows-x64-setup.exe` on Windows), not on the
  version, so a rename here silently breaks it.
- A new Linux variant (arm64, Flatpak, tar.gz) gets its own tail and is **added to
  `installerUrl()` in `DesktopUpdateChecker.kt`**. Pick by architecture; today the check assumes
  x86_64.
- Upload files to the release, do not rely on the generated source archives.

macOS builds are unsigned. Clear the quarantine flag with `xattr -cr /Applications/BitChord.app`.
If the app will not start, a missing library may need installing first with Homebrew
(`brew install <library>`; the exact library still has to be confirmed). The update check does not
look for macOS files yet, so Mac users get the release page.

## 4. How the app finds an update

`desktopApp/src/main/kotlin/com/music/bitchord/desktop/DesktopUpdateChecker.kt`, shown as a dialog
from `BitChordDesktopApp` in `DesktopApp.kt`:

1. At launch it calls `GET https://api.github.com/repos/kushagrasinghx/BitChord/releases/latest`.
2. It strips the `v` from `tag_name` and compares it with `bitchord.version` (numeric, dot by dot;
   a `-beta` current version is older than the same release).
3. If newer, it picks the asset for the running OS and shows "Update available" with Download and
   Later. Download opens the asset URL in the browser. If no asset matches it opens the release
   page instead. Nothing is installed automatically.
4. Network and parse errors are swallowed. No internet means no dialog.

What this means for releasing:

- GitHub's "latest" ignores **drafts and pre-releases**. A release only prompts users once it is
  published as a normal release. Mark betas as pre-release so they never prompt anyone.
- The git tag must be `v<version>` (`v1.8`). The workflow also accepts only `v*.*.*`; for a
  two-part version like `v1.8` use the manual `workflow_dispatch` with `version` filled in, or
  tag `v1.8.0` and make sure the tag and the stamped version agree.
- Linux and Windows files must be on the **same release**, because there is only one "latest".
  Do not publish a Windows-only release and a separate Linux-only one: whichever is newer becomes
  "latest" and the other platform will see no asset for itself (it falls back to the release page).

## 5. Checklist for a Linux build

Before publishing, confirm each of these on the built files, not just in the source:

- [ ] Version stamped (`-Pbitchord.version=<v>`). Launch each built file and check Settings shows the
      same version.
- [ ] `desktopVersionCode` is higher than the last published build.
- [ ] The three files are named exactly as in section 3.
- [ ] They are attached to the same release as the Windows files.
- [ ] The release is not a draft or pre-release (for a real release).
- [ ] Install the previous release, then the new one over it: deb with `sudo apt install
      ./BitChord-*.deb`, rpm with `sudo dnf upgrade ./BitChord-*.rpm`. It must upgrade, not
      reinstall or conflict.
- [ ] With the previous release installed, the "Update available" dialog appears and Download
      opens the correct file for that platform.

## 6. Quick manual test of the check

Run an old build with the version forced low, against the real latest release:

```bash
./gradlew :desktopApp:run -Pbitchord.version=0.1
```

The dialog should appear. Run it with the current published version and it should not.
