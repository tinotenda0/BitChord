/**
 * The upward half of the sleeve's vertical gesture: dragged up, the artwork
 * block pulls the queue in behind it, following the finger the whole way and
 * settling to whichever end it was nearer on release.
 *
 * Downward is deliberately not ours. The sheet the player sits in is what closes
 * when the sleeve is dragged that way, and it can only read a drag it was
 * allowed to see — so a downward crossing of the touch slop is left entirely
 * alone and this returns having consumed nothing at all.
 *
 * Which of the two it is can only be known at the crossing, which is why the
 * decision is made there rather than at the press. A pointer event reaches a
 * child before its parent, so consuming the very event that crossed the slop is
 * enough to keep the sheet out of an upward drag, and letting that one event
 * through is enough to hand it a downward one — the sheet's own slop detector
 * gives up the moment it sees a change already spoken for.
 *
 * @param travel how far the sleeve has to be dragged for the queue to arrive.
 * @param slide the 0..1 the player's whole layout reads off.
 * @param onHold true while the finger owns [slide] and false when it hands it
 *   back; the settling animation is parked in between so the two never write the
 *   same value on alternate frames.
 * @param onSettle the state the release decided on, which that animation then
 *   finishes reaching from wherever the finger left off.
