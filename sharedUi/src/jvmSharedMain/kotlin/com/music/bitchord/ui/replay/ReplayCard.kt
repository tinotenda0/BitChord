/**
 * One headline number, as a card you could keep in a wallet.
 *
 * ## Why a card
 *
 * A Replay's four headline facts — minutes, artist, song, album — are four
 * unlike things, and a grid of tiles gives no clue that they are peers or that
 * any of them leads anywhere. A card is a thing people already know how to read:
 * it holds one fact, it has a *front* you look at rather than a list you scan,
 * and a row of them says "there are four of these" without a heading saying so.
 * Tapping one opens Replay at the chart it summarises, which is the other half
 * of why it is a card — a card is an object, and objects can be picked up.
 *
 * ## Why it is built like a real one
 *
 * Every part of the anatomy is doing the job its real counterpart does, which is
 * what stops this reading as a rounded rectangle with a chip sticker on it:
 *
 *  - the **proportions** are the real ones, 85.6 × 54mm, so 1.586:1 — this alone
 *    accounts for most of the recognition;
 *  - the **cardholder line and member-since date** are the part that makes it
 *    *yours*. A card with nobody's name on it is a graphic; with a name on it,
 *    it is an artefact of an account, which is exactly what a year of listening
 *    is. There is no chip: a contact plate is the one piece of card anatomy
 *    that exists to be *inserted into something*, and on a card that is only
 *    ever looked at it reads as a sticker;
 *  - the **embossing** — a monospaced face, wide tracking, a dark offset shadow
 *    under a pale gradient fill — is how a real card's raised type catches the
 *    light, and it is why those lines read as pressed into the card rather than
 *    printed on it;
 *  - the **logo sits top-right**, opposite what the card is for, so the two
 *    corners of the head each carry one fact and neither is a caption for the
 *    other.
 *
 * ## Why the background is the player's own mesh
 *
 * Sampled from the artwork this card is about, so no two people's cards look
 * alike and each one is lit by the record it is describing. It is drawn once
 * and held still — [MeshGradientBackground]'s `animated = false` — rather
 * than crossfading or drifting, since a row of these redrawing a blurred
 * layer every time a card is opened or swiped past is the expensive case the
 * class note there warns about, multiplied by however many cards are on
 * screen.
