/**
 * lrc.red — Apple Music TTML, per-syllable, filed by ISRC.
 *
 * Every document lives at `https://lrc.red/s/{ISRC}.ttml`, so a track whose
 * recording is already known costs one request and cannot come back as the
 * wrong edit. That is the usual case: [BiniLyrics] answers its searches out
 * of this same catalogue — its `lyricsUrl` points here — and
 * [LyricsRepository] hands the ISRC it finds to every source that can use one.
 *
 * Without one, lrc.red's own search (`/search.json?q=`) is asked with the
 * title and artist, and the hits are matched here rather than trusted in
 * order: the search is a free-text one and ranks "Bohemian Rhapsody
 * (Operatic Section / 2011 A Cappella Mix)" above the song itself. See [best].
 *
 * Line-synced entries are TTML too (`lrc:timing="Line"`), which [TtmlLyrics]
 * already reads, so one parser covers both. The document's own
 * `<audio lyricOffset>` is ignored, as it is for every Apple TTML here — the
 * stamps are written against the release audio, which is what is playing.
