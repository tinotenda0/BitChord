/**
 * The app's own record of how each track came to be playing, as text you can
 * paste somewhere.
 *
 * Diagnosing why a track played from the wrong source, at the wrong bitrate,
 * or not at all has meant plugging the phone in and reading `adb logcat` — and
 * the answer is usually in a stretch lasting a few seconds that has already
 * scrolled past by the time anyone notices something sounded wrong. This keeps
 * that stretch.
 *
 * ### Why not read logcat
 *
 * The obvious implementation shells out to `logcat`, and it works. But from
 * Android 13 an app that does so trips a system consent dialog — *"Allow
 * BitChord to access all device logs?"* — which appears whenever the process
 * happens to spawn, asks for far more than this needs, and puts every other
 * app's output within reach of a paste made from a music player. None of that
 * is a reasonable price for a debug button.
 *
 * So the lines are kept here on the way past instead. Nothing is read back
 * from the system, no permission is involved, no dialog can appear, and what
 * ends up on the clipboard is only ever what this app itself wrote.
 *
 * ### What gets kept
 *
 * Only the paths that decide how a track plays: the resolver, the module
 * sandbox, the source ladder, the cache and the player. Deliberately not the
 * feeds, the artwork, the lyrics or the library — a paste that includes
 * everything is one nobody reads to the end of, and none of it has ever been
 * the answer to "why did this song sound wrong".
 *
 * ### Which lines are whose
 *
 * Every line is filed against the track it is about, and reading the log back
 * is a question about a track rather than about a stretch of time — see
 * [about] and [forTrack]. This app does most of a track's work nowhere near
 * the moment that track is playing: it is resolved while the one before it
 * plays, and the first seconds of every track are spent resolving the *next*
 * one. So "the last thirty seconds of log" is never the same thing as "this
 * song's story", and asking for one by way of the other pastes the wrong
 * song's log almost every time.
 *
 * Call [d], [w] and [e] exactly where `Log.d`/`w`/`e` would go; they forward
 * to logcat as well, so `adb logcat -s BitChord` is unchanged.

     *    resolving the next one, so a window running from the selection to now
     *    is largely the *following* song's story: its ladder, its client walk,
     *    its read-ahead. That is what a paste taken a few seconds into a track
