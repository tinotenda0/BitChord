 * Stream bitrate ceiling on the YouTube fallback path — MEDIUM, HIGH and
 * LOSSLESS all mean "whatever the best available Opus format is" there; what
 * actually tells them apart is which other sources are allowed to answer
 * *before* YouTube gets asked. That part is [permits], and the rungs read:
 *
 * - [LOSSLESS] — the user's own addons and JioSaavn both asked.
 * - [HIGH] — the addons skipped, JioSaavn asked.
 * - [MEDIUM] and [LOW] — both skipped; YouTube's own Opus ladder is all there
 *   is, capped at [maxKbps].
 *
 * [hourly] is what the ceiling costs in data over an hour of listening, which
 * is the only part of this a user actually cares about on a metered plan.
