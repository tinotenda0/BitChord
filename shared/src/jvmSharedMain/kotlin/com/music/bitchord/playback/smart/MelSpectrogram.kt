/**
 * The log-mel front end the Beat This! model expects, backed by the native analyzer.
 *
 * Every constant is dictated by the trained network rather than chosen: it was trained on
 * torchaudio's MelSpectrogram at 22,050 Hz with n_fft 1024, hop 441 (so exactly 50 frames per
 * second), 128 Slaney mel bands from 30 Hz to 11 kHz, and `log1p(1000 * magnitude)`. A front end
 * that differs even in window convention feeds the model something it has never seen, which is why
 * this is a port of the native C++ rather than a reimplementation.
 *
 * [sampleRate] is required, not preferred: audio at any other rate is refused rather than
 * resampled here, because resampling belongs upstream where full-bandwidth samples still exist.
