/**
 * This device's offset from the party server's clock.
 *
 * Everything the party shares is expressed on the server's timeline — a
 * position and the server time it was true at — so a device that cannot
 * translate that timeline into its own cannot be in sync, however fast its
 * connection is. This is the translation.
 *
 * The method is NTP's, cut down to the part that matters over one WebSocket.
 * Each sample is a ping stamped on the way out and a pong carrying the server's
 * own reading:
 *
 * ```
 * offset     = serverMs - (t0 + t1) / 2
 * roundTrip  = t1 - t0
 * ```
 *
 * and the error on that offset is at most half the round trip, because the only
 * thing being assumed is that the two legs took the same time. Which is why the
 * sample with the *smallest* round trip wins rather than the newest or the
 * average: on mobile data a single request delayed behind a radio wake-up is
 * wrong by hundreds of milliseconds, and averaging folds that error in instead
 * of discarding it. A short burst of pings on connect therefore converges
 * faster than a long series would.
 *
 * The local half of every sample is a monotonic reading, not
 * `System.currentTimeMillis`. The wall clock is stepped — by the network
 * operator, by the user setting the time, by a DST change — and any step lands
 * directly in the offset and moves this device's playhead relative to everyone
 * else's. `elapsedRealtime` is monotonic since boot and counts through deep
 * sleep, which is exactly the timeline a playhead should be measured against.
 */
