 * Windows' System Media Transport Controls — the volume flyout's media card,
 * the lock screen, and the media keys.
 *
 * The Windows counterpart of [DesktopMprisController], and the same contract:
 * the player hands it state, it hands back button presses. What it talks to is
 * WinRT, which the JVM cannot reach, so the work happens in `bitchord_smtc.dll`
 * beside the analyser.
 *
 * Absent, everything here is a no-op. The library is only built by MSVC, so a
 * Linux cross-build of the Windows archive has no SMTC in it — the installers,
 * which CI builds on Windows, do.
