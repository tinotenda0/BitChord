/**
 * Turns a queued track into an openable stream, using whichever source can

 *
 * Two things happen here that don't happen in any single [MusicSource]:
 *
 *  1. **The quality question is answered once**, from the connection in hand
 *     and the user's ceiling for it — see [requestForNow], or
 *     [requestForDownload] for the one caller whose answer becomes a file
 *     rather than a stream. Sources are told what to serve; they don't each
 *     re-derive it.
 *
 *  2. **The order is applied.** A track is pinned to the source that produced
 *     it, but a pin is a starting point, not a cage: with lossless on, a
 *     higher-priority source that can serve the same recording bit-exact gets
 *     asked first, and a source that fails gets stepped over rather than
 *     failing the track.
 *
 * Whether another source *has* the same recording is [TrackMatcher]'s question,
 * not this one's. Everything here does with a candidate list is ask that, and
 * everything a source is asked for comes from the same place — so the library,
 * a playlist, radio, search and the home feed all substitute on identical
 * terms, whichever of them a track was queued from.

     * Returning null is not a failure and needs no handling beyond falling back
     * to YouTube, which is what the caller would have done anyway: nothing has
     * been pinned, so the ordinary resolve at playback time is untouched.

     * The same search as [substituteForYouTube] with two differences, both of
     * which are only affordable because sound is already coming out:
     *
     *  - Every module *within* a source is waited for, including the one the
     *    live path gave up on to get playback started (`waitForAll`). That
     *    module is frequently the point: dropping it is what left the listener
     *    on a stream from whoever happened to be quick.
     *  - A result that isn't lossless is still worth having when it is
     *    audibly better than what is playing — see [worthSwapping]. Refusing
     *    those outright is what left a track on YouTube's 160kbps Opus while
     *    a 320kbps AAC from a module sat in hand, unused, because it wasn't
     *    the FLAC that had been asked for.
     *  - Every source is asked, not only the ones that can serve lossless. That
     *    follows from the bullet above: once a lossy stream can win, a lossy
     *    *source* has to be allowed to offer one.
     *
     * Where it matches [substituteForYouTube] exactly is in taking the first
     * answer that clears the bar rather than the best of all of them — see
     * [bestAcross]. The bar here is [worthSwapping] rather than "satisfies the
     * request", and it is a high one: anything clearing it is lossless, or a
     * gain of [UPGRADE_MIN_GAIN_KBPS] over what the listener is hearing. Holding
     * such a stream back to see whether a slower source can do better trades a
     * certain improvement now for a possible improvement later, and "later" here
     * was measured at thirteen seconds.
     *
     * The cost of that choice is real and worth naming: a slow source holding a
     * FLAC can lose to a fast one holding a 320kbps AAC, and the track then
     * plays lossy for the rest of its length, because [QualityUpgrade][com.music.bitchord.playback.QualityUpgrade]
     * marks a track asked once the answer is yes. It is the same trade the live
     * path makes, made for the same reason.
     *
     * [target] must carry the runtime of the track *actually playing* — see
     * [matchAndStream]'s use of it. Swapping the audio under a listener is
     * only defensible when the replacement is the same recording, and length
     * is the check that a title cannot fake.
     *
     * @param playing what the listener is hearing now, so a lossy candidate
     *   can be judged against it rather than against the request. Null means
     *   unknown, and an unknown floor is treated as one nothing lossy clears:
     *   a swap that might be a downgrade is worse than no swap at all.
     * @param servedBy the [MusicSource.configId] already serving the track, if
     *   known. Asking it again is wasted: the same source, asked the same
     *   query at the same tier, is deterministic and can only reproduce the
     *   stream already playing — which [worthSwapping] would reject anyway,
     *   but not before spending a search and a stream call on it. See the
     *   'isn't worth swapping ... off' log line this was written to stop.

     *     against what the lossy sources hold, and the better rendition wins on
     *     [isBetter]. This is where JioSaavn's 320kbps AAC comes in: it outranks
     *     YouTube for playback and used to be skipped entirely here, so a track
     *     streamed at 320 was filed at whatever YouTube's ladder gave.
     *  3. **YouTube**, by this returning null. Which is not a failure — see the
     *     floor below for when it is deliberately preferred.
     *
     * Steps 1 and 2 are started together rather than in sequence. A module
     * search runs to twenty seconds and JioSaavn answers in about four tenths of
     * one, and the whole lookup is bounded by `Downloads.SOURCE_LOOKUP_MS` —
     * queued behind the modules, the fast source would routinely have the
     * timeout land on it and the download would fall to YouTube holding a 320
     * it never got to hear about. Same reasoning as [bestAcross], for the same
     * measured reason.
     *
     * On the **High** rung step 1 is empty and every ranked source goes into
     * step 2's race, asked for [StreamRequest.Best]. A bit-exact answer to that
     * is refused rather than kept: someone who chose High over Lossless chose
     * the smaller file, and a FLAC filed under this setting would additionally
     * be missed by the already-on-disk check in `Downloads.prepare` — which only
     * looks for lossless extensions when the setting keeps lossless — and so be
     * re-downloaded on every pass through the queue.
     *
     * ### The floor, and why a lossy answer can still lose to YouTube
     *
     * A lossy candidate is only kept if it beats [YOUTUBE_BEST_AAC_KBPS] — the
     * top of YouTube's own AAC ladder. Anything at or under that is trading one
     * lossy copy for another and giving up the more reliable fetch to do it,
     * which is what the old blanket refusal of settle-fors was really protecting
     * against. So a 320 wins and a module's 128kbps MP3 does not, and neither
     * does a format that never stated a bitrate: a download has to *name the
     * file* before the first byte lands, and an unstated rendition is nothing to
     * judge. That last part is stricter than [streamBest]'s
     * [statesNothingLossy] allowance, deliberately — playback can hand an
     * undescribed URL to the decoder and let it work the codec out.
     *
     * ### Which settings get this far
     *
     * [DownloadQuality.LOSSLESS][com.music.bitchord.data.settings.DownloadQuality.LOSSLESS]
     * and [DownloadQuality.HIGH][com.music.bitchord.data.settings.DownloadQuality.HIGH];
     * not [DownloadQuality.STANDARD][com.music.bitchord.data.settings.DownloadQuality.STANDARD].
     * Standard is a 128kbps ceiling chosen to fit more on the device, and a
     * source cannot be asked for *that* rung — only for the best it has, which
     * is a bigger file than the setting exists to avoid. YouTube's ladder is the
     * only one that can be capped, so Standard stays entirely YouTube's.
     *
     * Note which setting decides this, since it used to be the wrong one: the
     * connection's ceiling ended this here instead, which meant a download on
     * mobile data took a transcode of a recording the user owns losslessly. That
     * was a data-plan setting deciding what a permanent file was made of, and
     * [AppSettings.wifiOnlyDownloads] does the data-plan job properly now —
     * before a byte is fetched rather than by quietly downgrading the result.
     *
     * @param target the recording to look for, off the row being downloaded. A
     *   blank title can only produce a wrong match; a null runtime is allowed
     *   and costs the length check rather than the search.
     * @param request what the download is for, pinned by the caller for the
     *   duration of one file — see [requestForDownload].

     * ### Why they race rather than queue
     *
     * Asking them in rank order is the obvious reading of an ordered list, and
     * it is wrong here, because the sources differ in speed by nearly two orders
     * of magnitude. Measured on '9:45':
     *
     * ```
     *   JioSaavn        search 245ms + stream 131ms   ≈ 0.4s
     *   Ricky's Addon   search → settled stream       ≈ 13.5s
     * ```
     *
     * Queued behind the module, JioSaavn's answer arrives at ~14s. Nobody is
     * waiting that long for a song to start, so YouTube wins the race in
     * [PlaybackService][com.music.bitchord.playback.PlaybackService]'s
     * `resolveWithModulePriority` every single time and the listener gets
     * 160kbps Opus — while a 320kbps copy sat four tenths of a second away.
     * Raced, the same answer arrives before YouTube's own walk finishes and the
     * track starts on it.
     *
     * ### What rank still decides, and what it no longer does
     *
     * Rank decides who is *asked* — [rankedAbove] is still what builds this list
     * — and it breaks ties between answers that arrive together, since each
     * sweep folds in everything that has already crossed the line and picks the
     * best of them with [isBetter]. What it no longer does is let a slow
     * favourite hold up a fast alternative.
     *
     * **A slow source is not thereby lost.** Whatever is returned here starts
     * playing; if it is [SourceStream.belowRequest] the track is marked for a
     * second look, and [upgradeFor] then asks *every* source again with no time
     * limit and swaps up only if what comes back genuinely beats what is playing
     * — see [worthSwapping]. So a module that needed thirteen seconds to find a
     * FLAC still gets to serve it, mid-track, and one that needed thirteen
     * seconds to find a 128kbps MP3 is correctly ignored. That is the trade this
     * whole path exists to make: sound now, quality shortly after.
     *
     * On the latency-critical path, sources still running when an answer is
     * taken are cancelled — the second look re-asks them properly, and leaving
     * them running would spend a listener's radio on a result nothing is waiting
     * for. The background-upgrade path passes [waitForAll], however: it already
     * chose to wait for every source's patient search window, so it must also
     * collect the resulting streams before choosing. Previously that flag only
     * reached each source's search call; this loop still returned the first
     * usable stream and cancelled the rest, which could discard an exact Tidal
     * FLAC or JioSaavn 320 result during an upgrade.
     *
     * @return the winning source alongside its stream, so callers can name it in
     *   a log line without searching the list again.

     *     about quality, not identity — and a catalogue that has already said
     *     it holds a FLAC is a better place to ask for one than a catalogue
     *     that said nothing. Without this the order was confidence alone, and
     *     a 16-bit FLAC lost to a Deezer row over how its artists were spelt.
     *
     *  2. **What comes back is checked against what was asked for.** A module
     *     that cannot serve lossless does not always say so; some quietly walk
     *     their own fallback chain and hand back a 128kbps MP3 with the right
     *     title on it. Reading [StreamFormat] before accepting the URL is what
     *     turns that into "this one can't, try the next" instead of into the
     *     listener's evening.
     *
     * The under-quality stream is kept rather than dropped: if nothing better
     * exists anywhere, playing the MP3 is still better than skipping the

     *     with the runtime being asked for to within a couple of seconds, only
     *     the candidates that agree are eligible at all. A catalogue holding
     *     the track under its right title and right artist can still be
     *     holding a different *cut* of it — a DJ edit on a compilation, an
     *     extended mix — and the runtime is what separates those when nothing
     *     in the title does. If nothing agrees, nothing is excluded: the
     *     runtimes are simply not informative here and the score stands alone.
     *
     *  2. **Quality decides between equals, second.** Among rows that are the
     *     same recording, one advertising a lossless copy is the better place
     *     to ask. This was doing that job *first*, which is how a 185-second
     *     "Punjabi Dj Holi songs" cut beat the 180-second album track on the
     *     strength of the word `flac` in its listing. A declared tier is a
