     * The value sent for `quality` is negotiated rather than asserted. This

     * as-is, which is what the reference host does unconditionally.

     *    stereo answer — which would turn every ordinary track on an
     *    Atmos-capable addon into a miss. `auto` is try-Atmos-then-stereo.
     *  - **It is asked for, not asserted.** Both gates are the same two the
     *    playback side enforces in
     *    [ModuleSource.unplayable][com.music.bitchord.data.sources.ModuleSource.unplayable],

     *    actually be accepted. With either gate shut the parameter is absent
     *    entirely and the addon's own default — stereo — stands.
     *  - **[putIfAbsent], never an override.** An addon that declared its own
     *    `atmos` setting has said what it wants; the manifest's default wins
     *    and this adds nothing. Addons that have never heard of the parameter
     *    ignore it, which is the same basis on which `quality` is already sent
     *    unconditionally.
     *
     * Nothing here names a particular addon. The decoder probe is cached per
