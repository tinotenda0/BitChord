/**
 * The wire shapes of the addon protocol this app speaks.
 *
 * An addon is an ordinary HTTP server, not code: it answers `/manifest.json`,
 * `/search?q=` and `/stream/{id}` with JSON, and nothing is ever executed on
 * this side. That is the whole reason this package exists alongside
 * [module][com.music.bitchord.data.sources.module] rather than inside it —
 * the two speak different protocols, and the module one has to download and
 * run somebody's JavaScript to ask the same two questions.
 *
 *
 * Every field the app does not need is absent from these classes rather than
 * present and ignored; what is here is what is read, and a field that stops
 * being read should leave rather than sit here looking load-bearing. The parser
 * is lenient and ignores unknown keys, so an addon that publishes more than
 * this — video renditions, chapters, DRM, ISRCs, artwork sizes — is not a parse
 * failure, it is an addon whose extras this app has no use for yet.
