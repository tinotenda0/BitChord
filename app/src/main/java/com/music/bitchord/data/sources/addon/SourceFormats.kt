/**
 * What kind of thing is on the end of a URL somebody pasted.
 *
 * The screen used to assume: whatever you typed was an addon whose manifest sat
 * at `/manifest.json`, and if it wasn't you got "that URL answered, but not
 * with an addon manifest" — true, unhelpful, and identical for a JSON file that
 * was simply a different *kind* of index. People paste all sorts of links at a
 * box that says "link".
 *
 * Two ideas run through this file. The first is that a manifest is a
 * *description* of an addon and the endpoints are the addon — so a missing or
 * oddly-named manifest is not a reason to refuse anything, and the last thing
 * tried is always "does `/search` actually answer". The second is that a
 * refusal should say what was found, not just that it wasn't wanted.

     *  1. **The link as given**, when it names a `.json` document. That is the
     *     whole point of accepting any JSON link, and appending `/manifest.json`
     *     to a document would ask for a path that cannot exist.
     *  2. **`{base}/manifest.json`**, the conventional location — tried second
     *     for a `.json` link and first for anything else, since a bare address
     *     is an addon's root.
     *  3. **`{base}/search`**, which is not a document at all but the addon
     *     answering for itself. This is what makes a manifest optional: an
     *     addon that never published one, or published it somewhere nothing
     *     guessed, still works, and there is no honest reason to turn it away
     *     over a missing description of something that demonstrably functions.
