/**
 * What this device has listened to, kept on this device.
 *
 * ## Aggregates, not an event log
 *
 * The obvious shape for listening history is a row per play, summed up when
 * something asks. It is also the shape that grows without bound on a phone
 * nobody is going to garbage-collect: a year of ordinary listening is tens of
 * thousands of rows, and every one of them is carried around so that a page
 * almost nobody opens can add them up once.
 *
 * So the addition happens on the way in. A track's total is a counter that goes
 * up while it plays, and reading the Replay is a merge of a handful of already
 * finished sums rather than a pass over history. The cost of that is what any
 * aggregate costs: the raw plays are gone, so a question nobody thought of in
 * advance cannot be answered later. Every question Replay asks is here.
 *
 * ## One file per month
 *
 * Buckets are calendar months in the device's own time zone, one JSON file
 * each. That is what makes "this year" and "all time" the same operation on
 * different numbers of files, and it means the only bucket held in memory is
 * the one being written to — the rest are read, merged and released.
 *
 * A month is also the granularity below which nothing on the Replay page asks a
 * question. Days are still counted, as a total per day inside the bucket, which
 * is enough for "your biggest day" without a file per day to get there.
 *
 * ## Nothing leaves the device
 *
 * There is no upload, no account and no id. [Backup] can write the whole thing
 * out as JSON because the user asked it to, and that is the only way any of this
 * goes anywhere.
