/**
 * Turns the player's ticking into the numbers [ListeningStats] keeps.
 *
 * ## Why it samples rather than measures
 *
 * The tempting implementation reads the track's position when it ends and calls
 * that the listening. It is wrong in every direction that matters: a track
 * skipped at 0:20 reports twenty seconds it did play, a track seeked back over
 * reports less than it played, a track left paused for an hour reports the same
 * as one played through, and a track the process is killed under reports
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * So this is fed from the service's existing progress sampler, which only ticks
 * while audio is actually coming out, and each tick contributes the *wall-clock*
 * time since the last one. Seeking cannot inflate it because position is never
 * consulted. Pausing cannot inflate it because no tick happens. The gap either
 * side of a pause is capped at [MAX_STEP_MS], which is what stops an hour on the
 * lock screen from arriving as an hour of listening on the first tick after
 * resume.
 *
 * The cost is that the few seconds before the first tick of each track are not
 * counted. That is a systematic undercount of at most one sample interval per
 * track, and it is the right way to be wrong: every alternative overcounts, and
 * a Replay that flatters is worth less than one that is a little shy.
 *
 * ## Minutes and plays are different questions
 *
 * Minutes accumulate continuously. A *play* is counted once, when enough of the
 * track has gone by to call it listened to — the same half-or-four-minutes rule
 * the scrobbler uses, so the two never disagree about what a play is.

     * is empty for almost everybody, and the artist rows have no page to open.
     *
     * The player already asks this same question, but only while its screen is
     * up (see MainActivity's `links`), so listening with the phone in a pocket —
     * which is most listening — would be exactly the listening that went
     * uncredited.
     *
     * One request per track, kept for the life of the process, and the answer is
     * cached a second time by the repository itself.
