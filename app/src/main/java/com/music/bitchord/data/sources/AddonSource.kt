         * `mp4` is in the list and is the interesting one. It names a container
         * rather than a codec, so it is not in [SELF_DESCRIBING_CONTAINERS] and
         * never overrides something better — but leaving it out entirely was
         * wrong in a way worth spelling out. A live addon's JioSaavn backend
         * answers `{"format": "mp4", "quality": "320kbps"}` with a URL ending
         * `_320.mp4`, and with `mp4` unrecognised *nothing* named the codec: the
         * format came back with a null one, and a null codec means
         * [StreamFormat.isLossless] answers "unknown" rather than "no".
         *
         * Unknown is not a harmless answer here. It is the answer that lets a
         * 320kbps AAC stream stay in contention against a FLAC when
         * [SourceResolver] is choosing between them, on the grounds that nobody
         * could rule it out. Recording the container says the true and useful
         * thing — this is MP4, and MP4 is not a lossless container — without
         * inventing the codec inside it.
