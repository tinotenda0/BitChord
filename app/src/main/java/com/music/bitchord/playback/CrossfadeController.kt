/**
 * A real crossfade: two tracks audible at once, the outgoing one falling as the
 * incoming one rises, the way Spotify and Apple Music do it.
 *
 * ## Why there are two players
 *
 * One ExoPlayer renders one queue item at a time, so at a track boundary there
 * is exactly one source and the gain it can be given is either 1 (no fade) or 0
 * (silence). The previous version of this class was a single-player volume
 * ramp, and that is precisely why it never sounded like a crossfade: it dipped
 * to silence at the join and climbed back out, leaving a hole where the blend
 * should be. Overlap needs a second decoder. There is no way around it.
 *
 * ## Which player plays what
 *
 * Two peers, not a player and a helper. Both are full ExoPlayers built the same
 * way and both can own the queue; at any instant one of them *is* the session
 * (it backs the MediaSession, holds audio focus and carries the notification)
 * and the other is idle. They swap roles at every transition.
 *
 *  - **[active]** — whichever player the session currently points at. The rest
 *    of the app only ever sees this one.
 *  - **[standby]** — the idle player. Between transitions it holds nothing. To
 *    arm a transition it is loaded with *the queue, positioned on the incoming
 *    track* at the plan's cue point, and started silently.
 *
 * The crucial word is **incoming**. An earlier version of this class put the
 * *outgoing* track on the second player: the session player jumped ahead to the
 * next song and the second player carried the old song's tail. That works, but
 * it forces a moment where both players render *the same audio*, and two
 * ExoPlayers cannot be started sample-accurately against each other. Whatever
 * they were misaligned by — measured on real transitions at 9 to 41ms — was
 * heard as the last instant of the outgoing track playing twice, at the head of
 * every single crossfade. No amount of tuning removes that; the duplication is
 * structural.
 *
 * Loading the *incoming* track on the standby removes it outright. The two
 * players never hold the same audio, so there is nothing to align, nothing to
 * hand over, and no seam to hide. The incoming track is simply already playing,
 * from exactly the right position, when its fader starts to move.
 *
 * ## The handoff
 *
 * Because both players own the queue, finishing a transition is a **role swap**
 * rather than a seek: nothing is re-buffered, nothing is re-sought, and no audio
 * is rendered twice. [onHandoff] is what performs it — the service moves the
 * MediaSession, audio focus, its listeners and its bookkeeping onto the incoming
 * player.
 *
 * It fires halfway through the blend — [HANDOFF_AT] — where the equal-power
 * curve makes the two tracks equally loud and the incoming one takes over. The
 * queue index, the metadata, the notification and the UI flip to the incoming
 * song there: not at its first, barely audible note, and not trailing the song
 * on its way out. Before it the incoming player is a silent-then-rising
 * shadow of the session; after it [outgoing] is the idle player, still audible,
 * being faded out.
 *
 * ## Curve
 *
 * `sin`/`cos` rather than the old `sqrt`: `sin²+cos²=1` exactly, so two tracks
 * fading past each other hold constant *power* the whole way through and the
 * transition has no dip in the middle. That is the standard crossfade law, and
 * it is what makes a long crossfade sound like a blend instead of a dip.

     * ## Why both sides are filtered
     *
     * The first version filtered only the outgoing track, and squared the
     * progress so that the sweep was spent almost entirely in the second half.
     * Both halves of that were wrong for the same reason: at the midpoint the
     * outgoing cutoff was still at 6.9kHz — wide open across the whole vocal
     * range — and the incoming track was explicitly set to no filtering at all.
     * So for the entire first half of every transition, two complete vocals
     * played over each other at comparable level, and the only thing
     * distinguishing them was gain. That is what a plain crossfade sounds like,
     * which is the one thing this is meant not to be.
     *
     * What a DJ does instead is hand the midrange over rather than double it:
     * the outgoing track starts losing its top the moment the blend begins, and
     * the incoming one enters high-passed — hats and presence only, no vocal
     * body — opening out as the outgoing track darkens. The two occupy
     * complementary bands through the middle of the blend and never compete for
     * the range a voice lives in.
     *
     * [FILTER_SWEEP_SHAPE] is what replaces the squaring: front-loaded now, so
     * the outgoing track's top is gone within the first tenth of the blend
     * rather than somewhere past the midpoint. What keeps that from gutting the
     * track being left is [FILTER_FLOOR_HZ] — the ride settles onto a 300Hz bed
     * and stays there — not restraint in the early travel, which is the part the
     * listener reads as the transition happening at all.
