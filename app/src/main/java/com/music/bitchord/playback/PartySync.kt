/**
 * Makes the player obey the party, and the party obey this player.
 *
 * Lives in [PlaybackService] rather than in the UI on purpose: a party has to
 * survive the app being backgrounded and the screen going off, which is most of
 * what listening together actually looks like. Bound to a composable it would
 * desync the moment somebody put their phone down.
 *
 * ## Telling the two directions apart
 *
 * The hard part of this is not moving the playhead, it is knowing *who moved
 * it*. A naive binder that reacts to player events and republishes them ends up
 * echoing its own corrections around the party forever. This one never has to
 * guess, because the two directions arrive through physically different doors:
 *
 *  - **Outbound** is [onLocalIntent], called only from [PlaybackService]'s
 *    `SessionPlayer` — the [androidx.media3.common.ForwardingPlayer] every
 *    *user* action passes through, wherever it came from: the app, the
 *    notification, a headset button, Android Auto. Plus the one thing that is
 *    the user's intent without being their action, the queue moving on by
 *    itself at the end of a track.
 *  - **Inbound** is [reconcile], which writes straight to the ExoPlayer,
 *    underneath that wrapper. So nothing this class does to the player can ever
 *    come back to it as an intent.
 *
 * One deliberate consequence: a pause this app did not ask for — audio focus
 * lost to another app, a call — goes directly to the player and is *not*
 * published. One person taking a call does not stop the music for everyone else.
 *
 * ## Losing the audio to another app
 *
 * That device must then also stop *following*, which is a second thing and not
 * the same one. [reconcile] exists to put a player that is not where the party
 * is back where the party is, and a player silenced by focus loss looks exactly
 * like one that has fallen behind — so it was dutifully seeking it into place
 * and pressing play, which took the audio straight back off whatever the
 * listener had just started. The song they had left came back over the top of
 * it, every seven hundred milliseconds, for as long as they kept trying.
 *
 * So focus loss detaches this device from the party until its own user asks to
 * come back ([focusLost]), and coming back is a catch-up rather than a control
 * ([rejoining]): the gap opened by being away belongs to the device that was
 * away, and publishing it as a seek would haul four other people back to where
 * one of them took a phone call.
 *
 * ## Following in time
 *
 * [reconcile] converges on [ListenTogether.partyPositionMs], which is the
 * party's position translated into this device's own clock. Three details carry
 * most of the weight:
 *
 *  - **Resuming waits for the scheduled start.** The server anchors a resume a
 *    few hundred milliseconds into the future so every device has one instant to
 *    aim at. Calling `play()` as soon as the frame lands would start this device
 *    early by exactly that lead — and being *consistently* early is worse than
 *    being occasionally late, because it is below the drift limit and would
 *    never be corrected. So a resume waits out [ListenTogether.msUntilStart].
 *  - **Drift is corrected by seeking, and only when it is real.** A seek is
 *    audible, so [DRIFT_LIMIT_MS] is set well above the jitter of two decoders
 *    running independently and at the level of an actual desync — a buffering
 *    stall, a doze, a device that came back from a tunnel.
 *  - **Position is only trusted once the clock is.** Before the first
 *    ping/pong there is no measured offset, so track and play/pause are applied
 *    and the playhead is left alone rather than seeked to a guess.
