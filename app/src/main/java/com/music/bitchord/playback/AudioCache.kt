/**
 * On-disk cache of the audio itself, and the read-ahead that fills it.
 *
 * Two problems, one cache:
 *
 *  - **Seeking.** Everything played is written to disk on the way through, so
 *    seeking back is always a file read. Seeking *forward* past what the
 *    player has buffered is the gap, and it closes once a track is on disk in
 *    full — which is why read-ahead fetches whole tracks rather than openings.
 *  - **Track changes.** The next track needs a stream URL resolved (an
 *    Innertube round trip, plus running YouTube's player JavaScript to
 *    de-obfuscate the `n` parameter) before its first byte can even be asked
 *    for. Fetching its opening ahead of time moves all of that off the gap
 *    between songs.
 *
 * The cache is keyed by videoId, not by URL: googlevideo URLs are single-use,
 * expire within hours, and differ between resolves of the same track, so
 * keying on them would cache every track afresh on every play. Because
 * [CacheDataSource] sits *outside* the resolving data source it sees the
 * original `bitchord://watch?v=<id>` request, and a cache hit never resolves a
 * URL at all.

     * The first id gets the full treatment: its opening onto disk first, so
     * it can start the moment it's reached, then the rest of it, so that
     * seeking around it is a disk read from the first second it plays. Only
     * that one track — never the one playing, and never bytes for anything
     * further out. Media3 locks a cache entry to a single writer and the
     * player holds that lock for as long as it is streaming the track — a
     * fetch aimed at the same entry is quietly served from the network and
     * written nowhere, spending the listener's data to cache precisely
     * nothing. Caching a track before it is reached gets the same result
     * without the contention. And full-track bytes for tracks that may never
     * be reached would spend real mobile data on nothing.
     *
     * The next [QUEUE_LOOKAHEAD] ids past that one get a lighter treatment:
     * just their stream URL resolved and held in [StreamResolver]'s own
     * cache, not their bytes. That's the gap a fast run of skips actually
     * falls into — the queue moving faster than a single-track read-ahead can
     * follow it — and a resolve is cheap enough that warming several at once
     * costs nothing worth guarding.
     *
     * Called freely; a call naming the same queue as the one already running
     * is left alone, and a different one replaces it outright, since on a run
     * of skips only wherever the listener actually lands is worth chasing.

     * ## Why the analyzer has to ask for this
     *
     * Nothing else fetches a track's opening early enough. The analyzer can only
     * read bytes some other part of the app happened to write, at the offsets it
     * happened to need, and neither of the two writers produces a head in time:
     *
     *  - Read-ahead's *byte* half is switched off outright whenever source
     *    substitution is on — see [prefetchQueue] — so a track that has never
     *    been played holds nothing at all until it starts playing. Measured, the
     *    next track's analysis then lands eleven to forty seconds late, which is
     *    after the transition it was meant to inform and sometimes after the
     *    track has started.
     *  - A quality upgrade fetches its rendition from the swap point onward, so
     *    the upgraded copy's first seconds are a region nothing downloads on its
     *    own, and the copy it replaced is discarded. A track that plays lossless
     *    from the start is therefore permanently unmeasurable however long it
     *    sits in the cache.
     *
     * ## Why this one is safe when [prefetchQueue]'s bytes are not
     *
     * The hazard read-ahead was disabled over is a key that disagrees with its
     * contents. [keyFactory] decides between `videoId` and `videoId#alt` from
     * the *global* substitution setting rather than from what a request actually
     * resolved to, so a fetch built from an id alone — which always resolves to
     * YouTube, carrying none of the title and artist a substitution is matched
     * on — wrote Opus bytes into the entry playback was filling from another
     * source. That is what produced `No valid varint length mask found` at the
     * seam.
     *
     * Here the key is pinned to the plain videoId rather than derived, so the
     * bytes and the entry they land in are both unambiguously YouTube's, and the
     * `#alt` and `#<rendition>` entries are untouched. The analyzer reaches this
     * copy through [renditionsOf] and cross-checks its container duration before
     * borrowing a beat grid across renditions, so a substituted source that
     * turns out to be a different cut is caught there.
     *
     * ## Why it fetches once, at full size
     *
     * An earlier version started at a megabyte and grew the request on each
     * later call, so that a track whose first attempt did not decode was not
     * stuck forever. That cured the dead end and caused a worse fault: every
     * round resolves the stream again, and the second round skips what is
     * already cached and writes the *remainder of a different rendition* into the
     * same entry. See [analysisHeadSize].
     *
     * The dead end it was solving is now answered from the other side. A copy
     * that cannot be decoded is deleted rather than remembered — see
     * [discardBadRendition] — which both frees the entry and re-arms this, so the
     * retry is a clean pull instead of a larger read of the same bad bytes.
     *
     * A no-op for anything that isn't a YouTube-backed track.

     * declared size is still the real one, so a container whose header describes
     * the whole track parses normally.
