 * this runs after has already landed — a tagging failure should cost the tags,
 * not the file.
 *
 * The lyrics are the one thing not fetched here. They come in as text from
 * [LyricsTag], started by [Downloads] early enough to overlap the transfer,
 * because that lookup races four services and is the one piece of this worth
 * not paying for in wall-clock time after the last byte has landed.

     * `Segment` size has to be rewritten in place — so both taggers have to be
     * able to reach any byte of the file. FLAC has no such constraint: the

     * an absolute file offset, and the frames are copied through untouched. So
     * the only part that has to be *read* is the front of the file, and the rest
     * is a stream copy.
     *
     * That distinction is worth the extra path because FLAC is also the format
     * this matters for. It is the one a download at the Lossless rung produces,
     * and a 40MB track through [readAll] plus a tagger's two working copies is
     * ~120MB of byte arrays for a job whose actual output is a few kilobytes of
     * text and a cover. On a hi-res file it is enough to fail outright, and the
     * way it failed was invisible: [OutOfMemoryError] is a [Throwable], the
     * `runCatching` below catches those, and the download finished untagged with
     * nothing said. Here the ceiling is the metadata region plus one 64kB
     * buffer, whatever the track's length.

     * @return true when the file has been dealt with — rewritten, or found to
     *   have nothing to write. False asks the caller to fall back, which happens
     *   only for a metadata region larger than [FLAC_HEAD_BYTES] or an I/O
     *   failure, and is safe at any point: the original is untouched until the
     *   finished copy replaces it in one move.
