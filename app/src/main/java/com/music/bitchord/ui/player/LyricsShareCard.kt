/**
 * The picked lines as one picture, drawn to a bitmap you can send.
 *
 * ## Why this is drawn rather than screenshotted
 *
 * The same reason the Replay is. A screenshot of the lyrics panel carries the
 * scrubber, the glow falloff, whichever lines happened to be on screen and the
 * status bar of that particular phone, so two people sharing the same verse
 * would send two different-looking pictures. A card laid out here is the verse,
 * the sleeve and this app's mark, and nothing else — and it is only as tall as
 * that verse needs, which holds it inside 1080×1920 (9:16): the shape a story
 * or a chat head expects. Keeping it there is the player's job, by refusing
 * more words at the pick rather than by shrinking them here.
 *
 * ## Why it isn't Compose
 *
 * `Bitmap` + `android.graphics.Canvas`, exactly as
 * [com.music.bitchord.ui.replay.ReplayPoster] does it, and for the same
 * reasons written up there: Compose offscreen on minSdk 26 is a cascade of
 * hardware bitmaps and layers that fails differently per device, while a
 * software canvas draws identically from API 26 up. The backdrop, the logo, the
 * fonts and the sleeve are shared with the Replay by importing them rather than
 * by copying, so the two cards cannot drift apart.
 *
 * ## Fitting the type
 *
 * A passage can be one line or twenty, so both the size and the height are
 * chosen rather than fixed: the layout is retried down a fixed ladder of sizes
 * until the rows stop overflowing, and the card is then grown to exactly the
 * room those rows take. The bottom rung of that ladder is a floor rather than a
 * last resort — no card ever sets type smaller than it to squeeze a passage
 * in, so a passage too long for the frame lengthens the card instead of being
 * cut, or made small enough to hold a phone at arm's length to read.
