/**
 * The Replay as a run of full-screen cards you tap through.
 *
 * ## Why a story rather than a scroll
 *
 * The page below this already has every number on it, ranked and scrollable, and
 * that is the right shape for looking something up. It is the wrong shape for
 * being *told* something: a scroll gives every fact the same weight and lets the
 * eye run past the one that matters. A story gives each fact the whole screen
 * and a few seconds of nobody else's attention.
 *
 * ## The layout
 *
 * Every card is the same three bands, which is what makes eight of them read as
 * one piece rather than eight designs: a sentence at the top with the number in
 * it set bold, the thing that sentence is about in the middle, and the share
 * button at the bottom. The sentence carries the meaning, so a card that has
 * lost its artwork to a slow connection still says something.
 *
 * ## The mechanics people already know
 *
 * Tap the right of the screen to move on, the left to go back, hold anywhere to
 * stop the clock, swipe to move by hand, back or the cross to leave. None of it
 * is explained on screen: it is the same everywhere, and explaining it would be
 * the first thing on a page whose whole job is to be effortless.
 *
 * The auto-advance stops at the last card rather than closing — closing on a
 * timer takes the share button away from someone reaching for it.

     * Two things here are the fix for two separate bugs, and both come from a

     *
     *  - **The step is taken from [PagerState.settledPage], not `currentPage`.**
     *    `currentPage` flips to the destination halfway through a scroll, so a
     *    tap landing during the auto-advance was computing "next" from the page
     *    the story was already on its way to — and skipping one. `settledPage`
     *    is the last page that actually came to rest, so the worst a mistimed
     *    tap can do is ask for the transition already in flight.
     *  - **It snaps rather than animating.** An `animateScrollToPage` that gets
     *    cancelled mid-flight — which is exactly what a second scroll request
     *    does to it — leaves the pager wherever it had got to, which is the
     *    story sitting between two cards with neither readable. A snap has no
     *    in-between state to be interrupted in. It is also what every story
     *    player does: tapping is meant to feel like turning a page, not like
     *    starting a transition.
