/**
 * The party server's address, on the card an addon is added with.
 *
 * **Mounted from [MainActivity][com.music.bitchord.MainActivity], not from
 * [ListenTogetherScreen], and it has to stay that way.** The card underneath is
 * a haze effect reading the app's own backdrop layer, and it covers the window
 * with a scrim — neither of which a composable inside the settings sheet can do.
 * Put here, it sampled a layer it was itself inside, so the frosting had nothing
 * to frost and the card came out fully transparent, and its `fillMaxSize` scrim
 * was bounded by a scrolling column instead of the screen, so the actions were
 * laid out somewhere no finger reached. The addon editor is mounted at the root
 * for exactly these reasons; this is the same card and wants the same place.
 *
 * Self-contained on purpose: everything it edits lives in [ListenTogether], so
 * hoisting it cost one callback rather than half the screen's state.
